Exercise 1.5:
Create a few files locally on your computer. Create a new repository on Github and push your files to this repository. Log on to a t2.micro instance on Amazon EC2 and clone your repository there. Make some changes to the files, push them again and pull the changes on your local machine.

(If you did not make an Amazon EC2 account in Exercise 1.4, then you should push your files and pull them on the gbar.)
