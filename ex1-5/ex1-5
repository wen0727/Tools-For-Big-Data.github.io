Exercise 1.5:
Create a few files locally on your computer. Create a new repository on Github and push your files to this repository. Log on to a t2.micro instance on Amazon EC2 and clone your repository there. Make some changes to the files, push them again and pull the changes on your local machine.

(If you did not make an Amazon EC2 account in Exercise 1.4, then you should push your files and pull them on the gbar.)

The edition from here are made from the AWS instance. Which would be commit and push to a branch of remote repo. https://github.com/wen0727/Tools-For-Big-Data.github.io.git

Fork the repostiory and conle to loacal machine. We also need to add remote repository of both the original as a UPSTREAM and the ORIGIN. So when the check the log of commitment with git-log they can see the pointers of the UPSTREAM AND ORIGIN.
