* Learning objectives:
- Numpy/Scipy for handling matrices and for scientific computing
- Scikit-learn for machine learning
- Cython for writing C extensions for Python code
- Pandas for managing and working with data structures and data analysis workflows

* Installation of the libraries.
- Numpy:
	sudo apt install python-numpy
	
Exercise 3.1 (numpy):
Write a script which reads a matrix from a file like this one and solves the linear matrix equation Ax=b where b is the last column of the input-matrix and A is the other columns. It is okay to use the solve()-function from numpy.linalg. Does the result make sense?
