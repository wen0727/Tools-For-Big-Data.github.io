The Unix-like operating system provide some commands are quite handy tools
at data operations. In the learning objectives, we will go through the specifica
commands with the syntax. First we are going to have a look at some specific
Unix or Unix-like commands. Second, we will have a look at github. In the end,
we will have a tour on Amazon EC2 cloud instance for cloud computing. 1.1
Unix shell or Unix-like shell
chmod is the abbriviation of “change mode” in unix shell. We can imagine the
command is a function and the inputs are the arguments of the function. One
of the implementation of the function is with three arguments. the syntax of
the function is as follows:
chmod[OPTION ] MODE [, MODE ] FILE
where chmod is the function and the words in italic font are non-terminals. We
can use the function to change the permissions for a file, for instance:
chmod g-w file1
where the command removes the group members’ write permission. The follow-
ing table shows the specific MODE s are defined for the correspoding classes.
